## Feedback

I am giving you 25/35 points for this project.

It is very clear that you know what you are doing that is awesome to see.

However, there are a few issues:

1) No comments. We asked for comments with your code in order for you to explain what you are doing and why. I do not see anything.

2) You fulfilled the first requirement (templating) and part of second (search bar). However, there is no call being made. It looks like you set up a handlesubmit to eventually be used but this was not passed from the parent nor is it in evidence of the App.js. I am guessing if you had more time you would have added this appropriately.

3) Neither requirements 3 or 4 were completed. If you had just added a favorite button or checkbox, that would have helped.

Overall, I am very confident you have a basic understanding of React and would love to see you finish this project.  :)
