##### Saturday, Nov 14th, 2020

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone or git pull or download this Final Review folder to your local disk. 

1. View the questions on the webpages on github.com within this repo, to be able to see the rendered code screenshots. Or use the preview feature built into VSCode.

1. Copy the Final Review folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp group's personal repository, so you may edit the contents there and push them.  

    For example, get the questions from

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_June_2020_Reviews/03_final

    And push your answers to

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/03_final

    
1. There's a folder for each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder.  

1. This review is in 3 parts

    1. **Multiple choice questions**. These have equal weight and add upto 20% of the evaluation. Please answer any 10 questions, marking skipped questions as SKIPPED. Answering more than 10 will cause all answered questions to be evaluated, causing a small disadvantage to your scores.

    1. **Small questions**.  These have equal weight and total upto 45% of the evaluation. Please attempt 15 questions. Please mark skipped question's answer as SKIPPED.

    2. **Practical portion**.  This is a small project, similar to class project that has 35% of the evaluation. You have 2 choices, try only ONE OF THESE.

1. This review is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a peer to show you the way, but not do the work for you.

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer. This is much like the real world.

1. Please git commit, git push your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.  Git push time stamps would be used to evaluate the answers.  If you do not complete the material, you would be given extra time. You would get graded on both sets of answers, the on-time answers and the late answers. Your final grade would depend on both answers. The late answers would attract a small penalty.


### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this final review is a test of how well prepared you are. A sincere effort would help you learn by taking exam. Trying to bypass the process by copying answers, will not help with that goal. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research. It is more important to learn from this experience, than bypass it. As such, let us set some ground rules

- ** Providing code is not enough. You MUST provide "short" explanations of how it works in comments to demonstrate understanding. **
- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- No sharing of answer code (strict requirement).
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel #_reviews such that all students have access to the same clarification. 


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?" where asked? Does your code have comments?

1. Your answer should be within a sentence or two.  Long answers are not needed as they take away precious time. You may download a VSCode extension which displays a word count in the status bar at the bottom for markdown (.md) files. Note the previous word count and then note what is the additional count because of your answer.

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error.

1. Have you annotated your code with comments so it is reasonably understandable?  Have you indented your code appropriately? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution.

1. Does your code work, where applicable? (40% weightage).


### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for overall success. 

1. You may take upto 5:00 pm on the review day to complete the review. Please remember to commit/push your answers before 5:00 pm.

1. Some credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. It is challenging to succeed without attempting the practical portion, as it holds 35% of the overall grade value. Even non-working practical portion may attract enough credit to put you over the passing mark.

1. Some questions are super easy, some are more challenging. To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, pace yourself, return to the difficult ones later. We recommend you attempt all questions, as seemingly difficult questions turn out to be not that.

1. Some questions are designed to not test your knowledge, but your ability to quickly research a topic, understand it and use it or explain it. Hence don't skip questions that seem unfamiliar to you.

1. If you do not succeed at this review, you will get another opportunity to retake the review, without any academic repercussion.
