Write a JavaScript function that checks how similar are two strings, which are passed in to this function as arguments.

Hint: Convert the string to an array and then loop over the array.

See example below ...

```
    This is a string
    There was string
      ^^^^^^^          <-- 7 differences
```

In the above example, the function should return 7.
