## Question A (50% credit): 

What does the following code do?  How can you reverse the order?

    ```
    var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
    points.sort(function(roo,raa){return roo-raa});
    ```

## Question B (50% credit): 

What's wrong with my code below?  How would you fix it?  Would using `var pi =` help? Why or why not?
