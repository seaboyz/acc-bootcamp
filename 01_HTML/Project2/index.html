      The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out
      of college, he started Apple with his friend
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> in
      1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II"></a>Apple II, on e of the
      first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. This was
      followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass0produced
      computer with a GUI(graphical user interface). After being ousted of Apple
      in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new companies: NeXT
      computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>. With
      the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve becae a billionaire.
      <br />
      In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the
      computer industry, and Apple was on the brink of extinction. Nonetheless,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field"
        >Steve was a fantastic salesman</a
      >, and used his business acumen to slowly bing the company back to
      profitablility.
