      <p>
        Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and
        I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am the proud owner of
        a car named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named{' '}
        <strong>Odie</strong>. Carfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while
        Odie is a dog without a brain. Althought my pets drive me <em>crazy</em>
        , I can't imagine life without them.
      </p>

        I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food
        to feed Garfiel. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite
        foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This inclues milk cheese, bread, ham,
        chicken wings, potato chips,pasta with marinara s\auce, frozen pizzas,
        and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasanga. When I come home,
        Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat thing in the grocery bag
        before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate
        everthing that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store
        to buy more food.I wasan;t too happy about that.
