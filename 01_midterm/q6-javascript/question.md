### Question 6:

Write a Javascript loop that will iterate from 1 to 5, both included, and log, if the number is ...

... odd or even.

Now wrap the functionality into a function that takes appropriate inputs as arguments (e.g. the smaller number, 5 here; and the larger number 15 here) and returns an object like the following ...

    {
      1: "odd",
      2: "even",
      3: "odd",
      4: "even",
      5: "odd"
    }


### Your Answer: may be provided as a code file with single function within it.
