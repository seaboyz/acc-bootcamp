### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need a honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research. It is more important to learn from this experience, than bypass it. As such, here are some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#midterm** such that all students have access to the same clarification.


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?"?  Your answer should be within a sentence or two.  Long answers are not needed as they take away precious time. Full credit given for answers in your own simple language that shows your understanding.

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error, no inputs or inputs of wrong datatype. For example, what if the user entered nothing, or a string data type, into a function that must have a numeric input? Or the user enters 1.5 into a function that requires an integer?

1. Have you annotated your code with COMMENTS so it is reasonably understandable? Have you indented your code appropriately so an instructor can follow your code? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution.  Lack of comments will attract -50% credit.

1. Does your code work, where applicable?


### SCORING STRATEGIES

1. We consider 70% of overall score is needed for passing this exam. 

1. Credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions, unless indicated.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. Even non-working practical portion may attract enough credit to put you over the 70% mark.
